## Map Function in Python
The map() function in Python is a built-in function that applies a specified function to all the items in an iterable, such as a list, and returns an iterable map object. The function is called with each item in the iterable as its argument, and the results are collected into a new iterable.

## Syntax
map(function, iterable, ...)
Here, function is the function to which each item of the iterable is passed, and iterable is one or more iterables whose elements are processed by the function.

Examples
Example 1: Squaring Numbers
Map Function Example - Squaring Numbers
This Python code demonstrates the use of the map() function to square each number in a list.

Code Explanation
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use map() to square each number in the list
squared_numbers = map(square, numbers)

# Convert the map object to a list and print the result
result = list(squared_numbers)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Function Definition:

square(x): Defines a function that takes a number x and returns its square.
List of Numbers:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: Creates a list of numbers.
Map Function:

map(square, numbers): Applies the square() function to each element in the numbers list using the map() function.
Convert to List:

result = list(squared_numbers): Converts the map object to a list.
Print Result:

print(result): Prints the squared numbers list.
Output
